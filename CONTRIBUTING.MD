We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue on <code>github.com/qoretechnologies/qorus-ui/issues</code> it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background of a bug
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- Expected behavior according to your understanding
- Current behavior which includes the bug
- Notes (includes, your reasoning behind the problem or steps you tried to solve the bug)

We _love_ thorough bug reports so that we can act fast on them.
